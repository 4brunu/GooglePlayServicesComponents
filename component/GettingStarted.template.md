The SDK requires the *Internet* permission(s) to work correctly.  You can have these automatically added to your *AndroidManifest.xml* file by including the following assembly level attributes:

```csharp
[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.Internet)]
```

You must also manually add the following element to your *AndroidManifest.xml*  inside of the `<application>` `</application>` tag:

```xml
```
